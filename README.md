# Simple Lastpass Workflow for Alfred

Simple yet powerful integration with the Lastpass CLI so you can now get your passwords out of your Lastpass vault and straight into the clipboard from within Alfred.

##Version 1.4.7 update - Please Read
###-----------------------------------------------------------

Ladies and gents, I am happy to present v 1.4.7 of the workflow. Before I continue, this has represented a SIGNIFICANT amount of work for me so if you like it and use it, please say thank you by donating towards my Diet Coke and cake fund. Any amount will do, whatever you feel the value is for you/your business/your time :)

**Please note you *MUST* update your LastPass CLI version to 0.7.1 or higher as this update relies on new functionality that I worked with the LastPass team on integrating into the official CLI. Additionally version 1.4.6 and higher of the workflow WILL ONLY SUPPORT ALFRED 3 (and are not backwards compatible)**

If you haven't used LastPass before... you are crazy and you should! It is the single greatest password manager package out there :D so check it out at [http://stu.link/LaStPaSs](http://stu.link/LaStPaSs) (Disclaimer, if you sign up through that link I get a free month otherwise you can go direct to [http://www.lastpass.com](http://www.lastpass.com).

## History

* Version 1.4.7
	1. Changed mechanism for copying to clipboard. Now marks passwords as transient, Alfred will no longer store them in the clipboard history.
	2. Updated icon submitted by [Tom Conroy](https://github.com/tconroy) has been merged in (thanks for this Tom!)
* Version 1.4.6
	1. Updated to work with Alfred 3 (long awaited official release of the long-in-testing beta version).
	2. Username display functionality submitted by [Guillermo Moreno](https://github.com/gmq) has been merged in with some minor changes (thanks for your hard work Guillermo!)
	3. Released with my apologies for the delay in getting this version out of beta... my masters course was INTENSE this semester, thank you to all of those that waited patiently.
* Version 1.4.5
	1. Fixed detection for when login has timed out, now correctly requests login.
	2. Fixed rare cases of login-script loops.
	3. Improved speed of copying usernames.
	4. Updated documentation.
* Version 1.4.4
	1. Merged in Ariel Barreiro's code submission which better handles two factor authentication (2FA).
* Version 1.4.3
	1. Fixed binary so that it is ACTUALLY updated (my bad #oops)
	2. Added a tweak to SIGNIFICANTLY speed up password copying to the clipboard #enjoy
* Version 1.4.2
	1. NOTE: This version *requires* the LastPass CLI v 0.7.1 or higher due to this new feature --> Login process completely changed over to use AppleScript (cleaner and nicer). This was thanks to work between myself and Bob from LastPass who maintains the official LastPass CLI to add a feature allowing an external login prompt to be used.
	2. Login password prompt now uses an AppleScript password prompt.
	3. Fix to allow you to search for words in any order.
	4. Vault item's which now require re-authentication will pop up the AppleScript login prompt.
	5. Has now been tested with a Vault with over 30,000 items for performance tweaks. (I have since been told by LastPass support their soft limit is significantly lower than this at ~2500 items explains why I was having some issues in testing).
	6. More resilient escaping of text in the XML to ensure that special characters should not cause any issues.
	7. Fixed missing quotes in some areas that could cause issues with spaces.
	8. Squashed a little regex bug and wiped up the goo.
	9. Fixed issues with spaces in certain paths we referenced
	10. Fixed how the initial login process is run after a reboot. This required the changes made to how we manage the login process and it has subsequently been cleaned up significantly.
	11. Other minor general tweaks.
* Version 1.2
	1. Bug - Removed deprecated framework code
	2. Bug - Merged [pull request #4](https://github.com/stuartcryan/lastpass-alfred-workflow/pull/4) from [jsquyres](https://github.com/jsquyres) "we-love-macports-too" to support macports installs of the lastpass-CLI
	3. Bug - Further improved on [jsquyres](https://github.com/jsquyres) code to support some additional install locations.
	4. Bug - Fixed bash script reliability, after two login attempts the script was often failing.
	3. Improvement - Improved sync behaviour to better support extremely large vaults.
	4. Improvement - Added new 'lpsync' command to force a sync on demand.
	5. Improvement - Changed behaviour to store login email in your Apple Keychain (set with 'lpsetemail yourname@example.com').
	6. Improvement - Added the ability to set the logout timeout and store in the keychain (set with 'lpsettimeout NUMSEC' where NUMSEC is an integer such as 28800, if you use 0 that will keep you logged in until your computer restarts).
	7. Improvement - Added hotkeys to the main functions.
* Version 1.1
	1. Removed code that worked around an old buggy version of pinentry
	2. Fixed incorrect handling of no search results found (previously reported CLI tools were not installed)
* Version 1.0 - Initial Release
