  * cache is encrypted
* access to (almost) all object information via this workflow
* download attachments via this workflow
* show favicons of the websites
* auto update
* auto Bitwarden sync in the background
* auto lock on startup and after customizable idle time

## Installation
- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/blacs30/bitwarden-alfred-workflow/releases)
- Open the downloaded file in Finder
- Make sure that the [Bitwarden CLI](https://github.com/bitwarden/cli#downloadinstall) is installed
- If running on macOS Catalina or later, you _**MUST**_ add Alfred to the list of security exceptions for running unsigned software. See [this guide](https://github.com/deanishe/awgo/wiki/Catalina) for instructions on how to do this.
  - <sub>Yes, this sucks and is annoying, but there is unfortunately is no easy way around this. macOS requires a paying Developer account for proper app notarization. I'm afraid I'm not willing to pay a yearly subscription fee to Apple just so that this (free and open source) project doesn't pester macOS Gatekeeper.</sub>

## PATH configuration

In many cases the bw executable is located in a path outside of the default system PATH.<br>
Please configure the Alfred Worklow variables PATH accordingly.<br>
In a normal terminal type `which bw` and copy the dirname (everything except the "bw") into the PATH workflow variable.<br>
The best is to append it to the existing string and separate it by a colon (:)

![Workflow PATH config](./assets/workflow-path-config.gif)

## Usage
To use, activate Alfred and type `.bw` to trigger this workflow. From there:

- type `.bwauth` for login/logout/unlock/lock
- type `.bwconfig` for settings/sync/workflow update/help/issue reports
- type any search term to search for secrets/notes/identities/cards
- modifier keys and actions are presented in the subtitle, different actions are available depending on the object type

## Search- / Filtermode

Up to version < 2.1.0 the *Fuzzy filtering a la Sublime Text* was default. Starting with version 2.1.0 Alfreds internal filtering is default.

You can change the search-/filtermode yourself easily. This gif shows the 3 steps which need to be done for it:
![Change filter mode](./assets/change-filter-mode.gif)

## Enable auto background sync

In version 2.3.0 the background sync mechanism was added.<br>
It is using the macOS user LaunchAgent.

To install the sync configure the workflow variables:

- `AUTOSYNC_TIMES`, this can be used to configure comma separated multiple sync times per day, e.g. `8:15,23:45`
- alternatively you can use `AUTO_HOUR` together with `AUTO_MIN` for only one sync time

Bitwarden needs to be unlocked for sync to work.

Install via Alfred keyword: `.bwauto`

## Enable auto lock

In version 2.3.0 the background lock and lock on startup mechanism was added.<br>
It is using the macOS user LaunchAgent.

To install the sync configure the workflow variables:

- `LOCK_TIMEOUT` set to a time in minutes after which the workflow should be locked if it hasn't been used in the meantime

The LaunchAgent checks every 5 minutes if the lock timeout has been reached.

The LaunchAgent checks also on load (e.g. startup of the system and login of the user),<br>
if the startup happened within the last 5 minutes, if so then it locks the Bitwarden workflow.

Install via Alfred keyword: `.bwautolock`

## Modifier Actions Explained

| type     | action name                     |
|----------|---------------------------------|
| login    | password                        |
|          | username                        |
|          | url                             |
|          | totp                            |
| note     | - (always copy the secret note) |
| cards    | card                            |
|          | code                            |
| identity | - (always copy the name )       |
| others   | more (to show all item entries, can't be NO_MODIFIER_ACTION) |

You can place per type *one* `action name` into the ACTION config, a combination is possible where it is *not* overlapping with `more` or another of the same type.

**Good examples:**

NO_MODIFIER_ACTION=url,code<br>
MODIFIER_1_ACTION=totp<br>
MODIFIER_2_ACTION=more<br>
MODIFIER_3_ACTION=password,card (2 items listed but of different *type*)

**Bad examples:**

NO_MODIFIER_ACTION=url,password<br>
MODIFIER_3_ACTION=code,card (2 items listed but of the same *type*, therefore this is not permitted and will cause problems)

## Source that helped me to get started

- [Writing Alfred workflows in Go](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/writing-alfred-workflows-in-go-2a44f62dc432)
- [Example of the awgo package] (https://github.com/deanishe/awgo/blob/master/_examples/update/main.go)
- [awgo package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/deanishe/awgo?tab=doc)


## Troubleshooting

- "I'm seeing the following dialog when running the workflow"

  ![image](./assets/catalina-warning.png)

  **Workaround:**

  Per [the installation steps](https://github.com/blacs30/bitwarden-alfred-workflow#installation), you **_MUST_** add Alfred to the list of Developer Tool exceptions for Alfred to run any workflow that contains an executable (like this one)

- Using `bw` cli and this workflow in parallel can possibly cause this error occurs `Unexpected error. Exit code -1.`

  The reason for that is when the `bw` cli is used in the terminal and the password is entered that a new session is initiated and the workflow's session invalidated.

  **Workaround:**

  You can use the bash functions created by @luckman212 and located [here in github](https://github.com/luckman212/bitwarden-cli-helpers)<br>
  Download the bash file and source it in your own `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`

- Getting a secret still takes very much time

  With version 2.2.0 this workflow decrypts the secrets without using the `bw` cli. This is much faster but it might possibly can fail.<br>
  If it fails it falls back and uses the `bw` cli to get the secret. The decryption takes then more time again, was in the previous versions.<br>

  **Workaround:**

  To use the workflows faster decryption you can [follow this instruction by Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/update-encryption-key/)) <br>
  to update the encryption keys to the new mechanism.

  The linked doc doesn't specify how to force creation of a new key. It's easy though:

  - Login to your vault.
  - Click Settings at the top of the page.
  - Under My Account, scroll down to Encryption Key Settings.
  - Follow the instructions provided.
  - Logout (and on again) from Bitwarden on all devices.
